###Link to the App

* The app is hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://alanrkessler.shinyapps.io/redbird/)

* The code can be found on [github](https://github.com/alanrkessler/redbird)

###Importing Data

* Data is from the [Fangraphs Auction Calculator](http://www.fangraphs.com/auctiontool.aspx).

* Pitchers and Batters data is downloaded as `.CSV`s and saved in the `data` folder.

###Draft Board

* The data table displays all of the available players in the draft. 

* The drop-down menu filters the table to show players eligible for that position.

* As players are drafted, type each player's name into the text box and press delete. Enter one player at a time. 

* Refresh the application to reset the table.

###Player Tiers

* The first table shows the number of players by tier and position for available players.

* The second table shows the number of players by tier and position for all players in the draft regardless of availability.

* Players are double counted if they are eligible for more than one position.

* Tiers are set up based on the following rules:
     + Tier 5 are players with fewer PA/IP than a set threshold for each position.
     + Tier 4 are players with a rank worse than the sum of all starting spots on all teams.
     + Tiers 1-3 are set based on k-means clustering using the dollar amount.

###Plots

* The dollar values for each player are plotted on the y-axis.

* The user can select whether to plot position rank or overall rank on the x-axis. The rank is determined on the order of the original data.

* The user can select whether to plot players that are no longer available.

* The slider below the plot adjusts the x-axis.
